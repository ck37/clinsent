# clinsent: sentiment measurement in clinical notes

**Key functionality**

 * Keyword-based sentiment measurement
 * Sentence segmentation
 * *To Add: Deep learning-based sentiment measurement*
 
This package is a work in progress. Manuscript under review @cobert2022.

## Install

### Python

Install the most recent code on GitHub via pip:

```{bash}
pip install git+https://github.com/ck37/clinsent/
```

## Dependencies

### Python

We recommend python version 3.8, as [3.9 is not currently supported by PyRush](https://github.com/jianlins/PyRuSH/issues/1), a dependency of MedSpacy.

## Examples

### Python

#### Keyword analysis

```{python}
from clinsent import KeywordFinder

kwf = KeywordFinder()
text = 'bp is improving, but o2 worsening'
hits, score = kwf.run(text)
print('Score:', score)
print('Hits:', hits)
```

#### Sentence segmentation

```{python}
from clinsent import sentence_segment

sentence_df = sentence_segment("Patient has low bp. Hx of poor a1c control.")
print(sentence_df)
```

#### Deep learning analysis

```{python}
# Add example here.
```

### R

Examples to be added.
